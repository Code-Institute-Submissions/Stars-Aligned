        "description": "It has been three years since I last imaged the beautiful emission nebula NGC 2359 or Thor's Helmet.  Located in Canis Major Thor's Helmet is approximately 12,000 light-years away and is about 30 light-years across.  The central star is a Wolf-Rayet star (hot star in a pre-supernova stage) which is creating the bubble structure as a the fast moving solar winds interact with the surrounding molecular cloud.  This has a strong oxygen signal which produces the blue color although there is some hydrogen.  There is a lot of faint nebulosity surrounding the main bright areas which was one reason why I did not crop it any further.\r\n\r\nI was not at all planning on imaging this this year, however, weather and available objects in my field of view made this an 'ideal' target.  Ideal is questionable as it sits low in the south sky where there is heavy light pollution and my FOV only allows a maximum of less than 2 hrs on it.  Oddly enough the Ha data was not great as I had trouble with getting good focus.  I had to toss the first night of data.  The transparency was not good and given the normal light pollution to the south made good focus challenging.  I had slightly better focus subsequent nights as transparency was better and decided to go with the data.  Conversely, the OIII data was very good, usually that is worse than the Ha but this time.  This turned out much better than I expected after seeing the initial data.  This image, not surprisingly, much better than my not so good image from 3 years ago - before PixInsight, smaller telescope, and DSLR.\r\n\r\nFinally, this is my first image taken with the HoTech Field Flattener as I will not be using the Focal Reducer/Field Flatter combo for galaxy season.  Although I will be concentrating on galaxies for a couple of months I wanted to see how it worked on a nebula since - the other reason I went with Thor.  I wrote with extensive help from Gary Imm a webpost on How Focal Reducers Work and attached the link here.  I also created a video How Focal Reducers Work as well.\r\n\r\nWebpost on How Focal Reducers Work:\r\n <a href=\"http://astroquest1.blogspot.com/2020/03/how-do-focal-reducers-work.html\"_new\">Link to Webpost article</a>\r\n\r\nYouTube on How Focal Reducers Work:\r\n <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4ins4hXIzLM\"; target=\"_new\">Link to Video </a>",

        "description": "This proved to be a very challenging object to process. Not only did I want to capture the OIII being ejected out, but also the details of the core. I combined 12 hours of data in Ha and OIII from 2019 with data I just captured in 2020 in HaOIIIRGB. RGB was only captured for the stars.\r\n\r\nThe Owl Nebula (also known as Messier 97, M97 or NGC 3587) is a planetary nebula located approximately 2,030 light years away in the constellation Ursa Major.  It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre Méchain on February 16, 1781.  When William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, observed the nebula in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl's head. It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure. It was formed from the outflow of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with the outermost shell being about 20–30% larger than the inner shell.  The owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45° to the line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe nebula holds about 0.13 solar masses of matter, including hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; all with a density of less than 100 particles per cubic centimeter.  Its outer radius is around 0.91 ly (0.28 pc) and it is expanding with velocities in the range of 27–39 km/s into the surrounding interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nThe 14th magnitude central star has since reached the turning point of its evolution where it condenses to form a white dwarf. It has 55–60% of the Sun's mass, 41–148 times the brightness of the Sun, and an effective temperature of 123,000 K. The star has been successfully resolved by the Spitzer Space Telescope as a point source that does not show the infrared excess characteristic of a circumstellar disk.",

        "description": "This is a reprocessing of this image I took back in 2018. I consider it one of the best datasets I've captured: pinpoint stars, nice sharpness and nebulosity detail. It was reprocessed from the same integrated master, but using improved workflows with PixInsight and Photoshop. My goal was to better emphasize the faint nebulosity and the colours of the background Ha. I find <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/374324/\" target=\"_blank\">my original processing</a> was already quite good, and it might have improved just a little bit. Nonetheless, I share it with you here - what do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments!\r\n\r\n[Original description below]\r\n\r\nThis is the great Witch Head Nebula, right between Orion and Eridanus constellations. Also known as IC 2118, this interstellar cloud is some 70 light years across, 800 ly away. The nebula reflects Rigel’s starlight, the 2nd brightest Orion star. Dust grains scatters blue light more efficiently than red, the cause of its blue tint. [1] This very wide field presents the nebula in its cosmic context – in a field glowing with faint nebulosity, and the surrounding Barnard’s Loop, NGC 1788 (in the left edge), Sh2-278 (bottom); and LBN 945 (faint dust in the left hand side).\r\n\r\nThe Witch’s Head has a very interesting story surrounding its discovery. It was discovered photographically by the German astronomer and pioneering astrophotogtapher Max Wolf. [2] Some sources state 1909 as the date. Others, January 16th, 1891. (I believe the latter is the correct one, but I have not yet found Wolf’s original publication.) I found Wolf's original publication. What a wonderful read! Wolf published a 1905's article, but it was hinted in plates from 1891! He wrote \"The nebula is composed of several streams of nebulosity, and has the appearance of foggy clouds driven by a fresh breeze\" [5] I strongly recommend reading it at [5] However, this nebula was likely observed some 100 years before that! William Herschel listed NGC 1909 in 1786, as a large 2º nebula, in…. an empty area of the sky – but the description matched IC2118’s. It is believed Herschel observed the right nebula but made a mistake when annotating its position on the sky. He annotated it as being 11 minutes of time east of Rigel, when it’s actually west! This being a recent conclusion, the Witch is known as IC 2118 instead of NGC 1909. [2]\r\n\r\nThe faint outskirts of the Barnard’s Loop are in the background, glowing in red. The field also presents Sh2-278 in the bottom edge. It is rarely photographed, but is a very interesting and beautiful, associated emission and dark nebula (LDN1634). Studies concluded it is either a remnant of Orion Molecular Cloud (formed from Orion OB1) or pushed to its location by the winds and pression of OB association. [3] Finally, in the upper left corner is NGC 1788, a reflection nebula also known as The Cosmic Bat, some 1300 ly away. A fitting name to this spooky area! [4]\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis image was captured in a very cold morning, from my session of 09/09. As described in some of my previous images, Spring and Summer (Oct-Mar) is the rainy period in Southeastern Brazil. Therefore, I have a great “hole” in my images for objects in those RA coordinates. I used the moments before sunrise to capture this image in a almost freezing 1-2ºC ambient temperature! A challenge, but the pristine clear skies were worth the effort! I was really surprised by the quality of the original data – processing was a pleasure and the SNR very good, which made it a surprise to find so much faint dust.\r\n\r\nI consider this to be one of my best works to date! The colors and nebulosity makes a charming, eye-catching spectacular field. I publish it a couple of days before the Oct 31st: my Halloween image!\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section!\r\n\r\nDate and Time: September 09, 2018; ~4h [local UTC-3 time]\r\nLocation: MG, Brazil.

Altogether, approximately 2500 young stars lie in this star-forming complex, including the massive O-type stars HD 46223 and HD 46150, which are primarily responsible for blowing the ionized bubble. Most of the ongoing star-formation activity is occurring in the dense molecular cloud to the south east of the bubble.\r\n\r\nA diffuse X-ray glow is also seen between the stars in the bubble, which has been attributed to a super-hot plasma with temperatures ranging from 1 to 10 million K. This is significantly hotter than the 10,000 K plasmas seen in HII regions, and is likely attributed to the shock-heated winds from the massive O-type stars.",

        "description": "A composite image produced from recent Ha data from the TEC 140 scope and older SII and OIII data from the FSQ106.  Steve and I imaged a handful of Ha frames recently on the Tadpoles as a holding target until our intended project target had sufficient altitude to image.  We therefore only gathered 13 x 1200s subs and I don't think we'll manage any more this year.  Looking at these Ha subs, I thought it would be fun to process the image by aligning our older December 2017 FSQ106 data (21 x 1200s each NB channel for the SII and OIII).  The resultant image doesn't stand too much close pixel peeping (and if/when we do gather more data on the TEC140 it will be a delight) but it was fun and I have allowed myself to play with a rich palette.\r\n\r\nFrom APOD: \"This telescopic close-up shows off the otherwise faint emission nebula IC 410. It also features two remarkable inhabitants of the cosmic pond of gas and dust below and left of center, the tadpoles of IC 410. Partly obscured by foreground dust, the nebula itself surrounds NGC 1893, a young galactic cluster of stars. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, the intensely hot, bright cluster stars energize the glowing gas. Composed of denser cooler gas and dust, the tadpoles are around 10 light-years long and are likely sites of ongoing star formation. Sculpted by winds and radiation from the cluster stars, their heads are outlined by bright ridges of ionized gas while their tails trail away from the cluster's central region. IC 410 lies some 10,000 light-years away, toward the nebula-rich constellation Auriga.\"\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",

        "description": "It has been three years since I last imaged the beautiful emission nebula NGC 2359 or Thor's Helmet.  Located in Canis Major Thor's Helmet is approximately 12,000 light-years away and is about 30 light-years across.  The central star is a Wolf-Rayet star (hot star in a pre-supernova stage) which is creating the bubble structure as a the fast moving solar winds interact with the surrounding molecular cloud.  This has a strong oxygen signal which produces the blue color although there is some hydrogen.  There is a lot of faint nebulosity surrounding the main bright areas which was one reason why I did not crop it any further.\r\n\r\nI was not at all planning on imaging this this year, however, weather and available objects in my field of view made this an 'ideal' target.  Ideal is questionable as it sits low in the south sky where there is heavy light pollution and my FOV only allows a maximum of less than 2 hrs on it.  Oddly enough the Ha data was not great as I had trouble with getting good focus.  I had to toss the first night of data.  The transparency was not good and given the normal light pollution to the south made good focus challenging.  I had slightly better focus subsequent nights as transparency was better and decided to go with the data.  Conversely, the OIII data was very good, usually that is worse than the Ha but this time.  This turned out much better than I expected after seeing the initial data.  This image, not surprisingly, much better than my not so good image from 3 years ago - before PixInsight, smaller telescope, and DSLR.\r\n\r\nFinally, this is my first image taken with the HoTech Field Flattener as I will not be using the Focal Reducer/Field Flatter combo for galaxy season.  Although I will be concentrating on galaxies for a couple of months I wanted to see how it worked on a nebula since - the other reason I went with Thor.  I wrote with extensive help from Gary Imm a webpost on How Focal Reducers Work and attached the link here.  I also created a video How Focal Reducers Work as well.\r\n\r\nWebpost on How Focal Reducers Work:\r\n <a href=\"http://astroquest1.blogspot.com/2020/03/how-do-focal-reducers-work.html\"_new\">Link to Webpost article</a>\r\n\r\nYouTube on How Focal Reducers Work:\r\n <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4ins4hXIzLM\"; target=\"_new\">Link to Video </a>",

        "description": "This proved to be a very challenging object to process. Not only did I want to capture the OIII being ejected out, but also the details of the core. I combined 12 hours of data in Ha and OIII from 2019 with data I just captured in 2020 in HaOIIIRGB. RGB was only captured for the stars.\r\n\r\nThe Owl Nebula (also known as Messier 97, M97 or NGC 3587) is a planetary nebula located approximately 2,030 light years away in the constellation Ursa Major.  It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre Méchain on February 16, 1781.  When William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, observed the nebula in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl's head. It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure. It was formed from the outflow of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with the outermost shell being about 20–30% larger than the inner shell.  The owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45° to the line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe nebula holds about 0.13 solar masses of matter, including hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; all with a density of less than 100 particles per cubic centimeter.  Its outer radius is around 0.91 ly (0.28 pc) and it is expanding with velocities in the range of 27–39 km/s into the surrounding interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nThe 14th magnitude central star has since reached the turning point of its evolution where it condenses to form a white dwarf. It has 55–60% of the Sun's mass, 41–148 times the brightness of the Sun, and an effective temperature of 123,000 K. The star has been successfully resolved by the Spitzer Space Telescope as a point source that does not show the infrared excess characteristic of a circumstellar disk.",

So I used the little 5\" to observe and the Omegon MiniTrack LX3 to image the Rosette region with the 85mm. \r\n\r\nWhile I made a few tests with the LX3, I let the baby newton run on M101, unguided and with  manual polar alignment only. I used my car as a windbreak as much as possible and was really surprised how well that turned out. Another kind of lucky imaging😄",

        "description": "This is a reprocessing of this image I took back in 2018. I consider it one of the best datasets I've captured: pinpoint stars, nice sharpness and nebulosity detail. It was reprocessed from the same integrated master, but using improved workflows with PixInsight and Photoshop. My goal was to better emphasize the faint nebulosity and the colours of the background Ha. I find <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/374324/\" target=\"_blank\">my original processing</a> was already quite good, and it might have improved just a little bit. Nonetheless, I share it with you here - what do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments!\r\n\r\n[Original description below]\r\n\r\nThis is the great Witch Head Nebula, right between Orion and Eridanus constellations. Also known as IC 2118, this interstellar cloud is some 70 light years across, 800 ly away. The nebula reflects Rigel’s starlight, the 2nd brightest Orion star. Dust grains scatters blue light more efficiently than red, the cause of its blue tint. [1] This very wide field presents the nebula in its cosmic context – in a field glowing with faint nebulosity, and the surrounding Barnard’s Loop, NGC 1788 (in the left edge), Sh2-278 (bottom); and LBN 945 (faint dust in the left hand side).\r\n\r\nThe Witch’s Head has a very interesting story surrounding its discovery. It was discovered photographically by the German astronomer and pioneering astrophotogtapher Max Wolf. [2] Some sources state 1909 as the date. Others, January 16th, 1891. (I believe the latter is the correct one, but I have not yet found Wolf’s original publication.) I found Wolf's original publication. What a wonderful read! Wolf published a 1905's article, but it was hinted in plates from 1891! He wrote \"The nebula is composed of several streams of nebulosity, and has the appearance of foggy clouds driven by a fresh breeze\" [5] I strongly recommend reading it at [5] However, this nebula was likely observed some 100 years before that! William Herschel listed NGC 1909 in 1786, as a large 2º nebula, in…. an empty area of the sky – but the description matched IC2118’s. It is believed Herschel observed the right nebula but made a mistake when annotating its position on the sky. He annotated it as being 11 minutes of time east of Rigel, when it’s actually west! This being a recent conclusion, the Witch is known as IC 2118 instead of NGC 1909. [2]\r\n\r\nThe faint outskirts of the Barnard’s Loop are in the background, glowing in red. The field also presents Sh2-278 in the bottom edge. It is rarely photographed, but is a very interesting and beautiful, associated emission and dark nebula (LDN1634). Studies concluded it is either a remnant of Orion Molecular Cloud (formed from Orion OB1) or pushed to its location by the winds and pression of OB association. [3] Finally, in the upper left corner is NGC 1788, a reflection nebula also known as The Cosmic Bat, some 1300 ly away. A fitting name to this spooky area! [4]\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis image was captured in a very cold morning, from my session of 09/09. As described in some of my previous images, Spring and Summer (Oct-Mar) is the rainy period in Southeastern Brazil. Therefore, I have a great “hole” in my images for objects in those RA coordinates. I used the moments before sunrise to capture this image in a almost freezing 1-2ºC ambient temperature! A challenge, but the pristine clear skies were worth the effort! I was really surprised by the quality of the original data – processing was a pleasure and the SNR very good, which made it a surprise to find so much faint dust.\r\n\r\nI consider this to be one of my best works to date! The colors and nebulosity makes a charming, eye-catching spectacular field. I publish it a couple of days before the Oct 31st: my Halloween image!\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section!\r\n\r\nDate and Time: September 09, 2018; ~4h [local UTC-3 time]\r\nLocation: MG, Brazil.

Steve and I imaged a handful of Ha frames recently on the Tadpoles as a holding target until our intended project target had sufficient altitude to image.  We therefore only gathered 13 x 1200s subs and I don't think we'll manage any more this year.  Looking at these Ha subs, I thought it would be fun to process the image by aligning our older December 2017 FSQ106 data (21 x 1200s each NB channel for the SII and OIII).  The resultant image doesn't stand too much close pixel peeping (and if/when we do gather more data on the TEC140 it will be a delight) but it was fun and I have allowed myself to play with a rich palette.\r\n\r\nFrom APOD: \"This telescopic close-up shows off the otherwise faint emission nebula IC 410. It also features two remarkable inhabitants of the cosmic pond of gas and dust below and left of center, the tadpoles of IC 410. Partly obscured by foreground dust, the nebula itself surrounds NGC 1893, a young galactic cluster of stars. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, the intensely hot, bright cluster stars energize the glowing gas. Composed of denser cooler gas and dust, the tadpoles are around 10 light-years long and are likely sites of ongoing star formation. Sculpted by winds and radiation from the cluster stars, their heads are outlined by bright ridges of ionized gas while their tails trail away from the cluster's central region. IC 410 lies some 10,000 light-years away, toward the nebula-rich constellation Auriga.\"\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",

        "description": "<p>M13 - Hercules Globular Cluster</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have returned to the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules. On the very few nights here lately I have been looking for a small quick target to shoot around the 5-6am time frame just before the sun comes up, (and while the bright full moon is high in the sky), and well M13 goes right close to zenith then, and since I love this glob it was an easy choice.  Since the <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/354604/B/?image_list_page=3&amp;nc=&amp;nce=\">first time visiting this cluster back in 2018</a> I feel I have learned quite a bit, and improved some optical issues with my OTA, but imaging at the smaller image scale of 0.5\"/px required me to pull out some old tricks I had learned the first time.
